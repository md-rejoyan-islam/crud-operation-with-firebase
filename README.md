# CRUD opearation using Firebase

This project aims to create a simple CRUD application using React and Firebase. Users will be able to perform basic operations on tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting them. We’ll integrate Google and Facebook authentication for user sign-in, and use Firebase storage to handle file uploads. Finally, we’ll deploy the project to Firebase Hosting.
